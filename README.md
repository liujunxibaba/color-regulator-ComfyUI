# color-regulator-ComfyUI
I co-created a ComfyUI plugin with my friend zhulvxing, which allows you to insert a reference image, learn about saturation, lighting, and tone, and then reapply those values to another image. The node provides a port for adjusting the degree of learning, allowing you to experiment with various styles and forms.
